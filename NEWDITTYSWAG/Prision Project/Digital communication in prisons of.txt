Digital Literacy: Exposure to technology improves digital literacy, a valuable skill for reintegration into society.
Cost Savings:

Paper Reduction: Digital communication reduces paper usage, printing costs, and mail processing expenses.
Efficiency: Streamlined processes save time for both inmates and staff.
Security and Monitoring:

Content Filtering: Digital systems can automatically scan messages for prohibited content.
Audit Trails: Detailed logs track communication history, aiding investigations if needed.
Rehabilitation and Mental Health:

Positive Distraction: Access to digital content (e.g., e-books, educational videos) provides positive distractions for inmates.
Reduced Isolation: Regular communication improves mental well-being and reduces recidivism.
Legal Correspondence:

Secure Channels: Digital platforms ensure confidential attorney-client communication.
Efficiency: Faster communication with legal representatives aids case management.
Inmate Services and Information:

Access to Resources: Inmates can learn about facility rules, programs, and services through digital channels.
